# Introduction to link2GI

### GEOSTAT Summer School
**Prague, August 2018** - [Web site](https://geostat-course.org/2018)

The @color[blue](**LINK2gi**) is a straightforward small framework to simplify the usage of major commandline GIS APIs from R. 

As shown during the week, using GIS with R is pretty easy

So why then even a package like @color[blue](**LINK2gi**)?

## some real world aspects
@ul

  - The operating system phenomenon
    - Different user privileges
    - Limited knowledge of system and command line
    - Weird interface updates from one OS release to the other
  - cross platform collaboration limitations due to slightly different licenses formats etc. 
  - extreme varying command line interpreter capabilities
  
@ulend

That means no need for action for probably most of the people hanging around here. 
**But** for companys, university working places wiout full privileges, R-specialsts but no computer and/or GIS specialists, fast prototyping across software and systems and so forth...
